## Background

I really like Atom's [git-plus](https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus) extension. Now I've switched to VS Code, and I really miss it. git-plus is baked into my workflow, especially the ability to quickly stage and unstage files through the command palette, without touching my mouse. So I had to rebuild it.

I don't aim to rebuild all features of git-plus because I haven't used all of them. But contributions are welcome.

Props to [Akonwi Ngoh](https://github.com/akonwi) for creating git-plus.

## Contribute

1. Clone it
2. Run `npm install`
3. Open a terminal and run `npm run dev`
4. Open the project in VS Code and press `F5`
